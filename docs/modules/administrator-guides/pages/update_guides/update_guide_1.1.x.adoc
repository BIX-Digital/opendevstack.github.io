= Update from 1.0.x to 1.1.x

1.1.x requires Tailor https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor/releases/tag/v0.9.4[0.9.4].

There are no further mandatory changes apart from the general procedure
described above when updating from 1.0.x.

Users are highly recommended to take a look at the updates done to the
boilerplates, especially the `Jenkinsfile` and `Dockerfile`. E.g. the Python
quickstarter is now building an image containing all dependencies instead of
installing them during runtime.
